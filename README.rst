openssl-pkcs11-sign-provider
============================

This repository provides the implementation of an OpenSSL Provider for
asymmetric operations with private PKCS#11 keys. Requests with other key
material will be forwarded to an OpenSSL built-in provider.

This provider is a prove-of-concept at the current state.

build
-----

This project requires OpenSSL 3.0 or later, as well as opencryptoki. Support
for other PKCS#11 implementations is currently not available.

To build the provider, use the following commands:

.. code::

    autoreconf -fiv
    ./configure
    make


test
----

This project provides some base test for the provider. The provider is
PKCS#11-Module independent, but at the moment opencryptoki is the only
tested module.

The tests require a working opencryptoki setup. By default, the all keys are
stored in the token `softtok` in slot `3`. The setup script uses the PIN
`12345678` by default.

To setup and run the tests with the default settings for opencryptoki, use
the following commands:

.. code::

   make clean
   make test


To setup and run the tests with other token/slot settings for opencryptoki,
use the following commands:

.. code::

   export OCK_USER_PIN="4711"
   export OCK_SLOT="42"
   export OCK_TOKEN="othertok"

   make clean
   make test


.. note::

   The module setup is only executed, if the module's temporary
   sub-directory doesn't exist. This sub-directory is removed for all clean
   targets (e.g. `make clean`).


.. note::

   Attention! The setup script will remove generated key material in the
   PKCS#11 token by name. Please make sure, that no other keys with the same
   name exists in the token, otherwise they will be removed as well! It is
   highly recommended to backup all key material of a token, before starting
   with testing.


If the environment variables `PKCS11SIGN_DEBUG` (path to the logfile) is
set, the provider will write debug output to a log-file. The environment
variable `PKCS11SIGN_DEBUG_LEVEL` specifies the log-level error (0), warning
(1) or debug (3).


install
-------

The installation step may require further permissions. To install the
provider library, use the following commands:

.. code::

    make
    sudo make install


configuration
-------------

For configuration, please refer to `docs/pkcs11sign_interface.rst`.
